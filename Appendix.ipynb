    "## Binary Probbility Distributions\n",
    "A binary probability distribution occurs when you look at an event or a series of events that each have two possible, mutually exclusive outcomes. Flipping a perfectly flat coin is the most basic example - you could get heads or tails, but you can't get both.\n",

    "The probability of each possible outcome for an event adds up to 1. Outcomes are typically represented with capital letters, while events are represented with lowercase letters. We'll use `H` for heads, and `T` for tails. `P(A)` will be used to represent the probability that outcome `A` occurs.\n",
